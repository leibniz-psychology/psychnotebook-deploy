Governing Law and Jurisdiction
===============================

This Agreement is governed by German law. The courts in the Federal
Republic of Germany, in particular the courts at the registered office
of ZPID in Trier, shall have jurisdiction for all disputes arising from

Processing of personal data 
============================

PsychNotebook will not share your personal data that we collect during

-   to examine and/or end violations against the terms of use

The processing of your personal data is necessary for performance of the 
contract that you concluded when consenting to the terms and conditions 
stipulated in Terms of Use of PsychNotebook. Thus, we process your data 
on the legal basis of Article 6, Paragraph 1, Letter b DSGVO (Data 
Protection Regulation). As the provision of PsychNotebook has been 
entrusted to ZPID as a task in the public interest, Article 6, 
Paragraph 1, Letter e of the DSGVO (General Data Protection Regulation) 
constitutes another lawful basis for the processing of your data. More 
specifically, we may access your data for reasons like fraud prevention 
and IT security as well as to set up and maintain the service.

=============================

Your personal data will be available to PsychNotebook as long as your

Your personal data will be processed exclusively by employees of ZPID, in 
particular the PsychNotebook team.
